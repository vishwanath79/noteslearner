T: Hoisting
D: JavaScript's default behavior of moving declarations to the top of their scope before code execution. Variables and function declarations are moved to the top of their respective scopes.

T: let vs var
D: let is block-scoped while var is function-scoped. let doesn't allow redeclaration and doesn't get hoisted to the top of its scope like var does.

T: Closure
D: A closure is the combination of a function bundled together with references to its surrounding state. It gives you access to an outer function's scope from an inner function.
