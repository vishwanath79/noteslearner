D: The key to hacking yourself is to increase your awareness of your emotional state. When you become aware that you are angry, the anger is losing the grip it has over you.

D: A Wittgenstein's ladder is a simplified explanation of a technical or complex subject that is used as a teaching tool, despite being technically wrong. The term stems from proposition number 6.54 in Austrian philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein's 1921 philosophical work Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus, in which he states that although his propositions are at some level incorrect, they can be used like steps on a ladder to help one reach an understanding of higher level concepts.[1]

T: Quote
D: we are both 1bn+ asian wannabe superpowers with millenia-old civilisations. our population centers rely on the same aquifers. we are capable of turning the glistening skylines of shanghai and hong kong into smoking rubble. they could flatten delhi and mumbai if they felt like it. no country can totally defeat the other, which is why our relation is so complicated. previously, there was the nation of tibet which acted as a physical and cultural barrier between Hindustan and the Middle Kingdom. Then the communists came to power and illegally occupied tibet, bringing them right next to us. Since then, they have occupied patches of our territory (while continually claiming more), and more recently, started to use our gangrenous amputated limb (Pakistan) against us.

T: Quote
D: Despite being intimidated at first, I was quickly disarmed by George’s simplicity and kindness. Eastern philosophy teaches that we frequently are drawn into circumstances where we will meet our close friends from previous lives so that the relationship can progress. The soul immediately recognizes that person and the relationship picks up from where we left off at the time we were separated by death. Friendship is the highest expression of love, whether it is expressed between husband and wife or guru and disciple, and mutual love for God is one of the highest forms of friendship. It is natural and created without our willing it so and without compulsion. It is perfected over many incarnations until it is transformed into pure divine love in its highest expression. With George I had that intuitive feeling of recognition initially, and years later when I became steadfast on my spiritual path, I realized I must have known him before and that he was the instrument God had chosen to introduce me to my spiritual path and guru.

T: Quote
D: At the end of the second volume, one of the main characters lays out the trilogy’s animating philosophy. No civilization should ever announce its presence to the cosmos, he says. Any other civilization that learns of its existence will perceive it as a threat to expand—as all civilizations do, eliminating their competitors until they encounter one with superior technology and are themselves eliminated. This grim cosmic outlook is called “dark-forest theory,” because it conceives of every civilization in the universe as a hunter hiding in a moonless woodland, listening for the first rustlings of a rival.

T: Quote
D: I think the environment is the crucial factor. If you naturally let yourself question, ponder, develop things you come up with ideas. And all of the environment accept these and in no way diminish any form of innovative behavior. This is then again linked to the concept that an idea is an network. So people are needed together. And i would like to add that imo it can't be boosted with incentives.

D: –Dr. Martin Luther King

T: Quote
D: Fripp is a musician who revels in intelligent observations, and Wilson recalls one in particular concerning the Crimson King album. "He told me that he believed the traditional notion of genius is wrong: this idea that there are certain artists in the world who are musical geniuses. He believes that genius is something that visits people temporarily and then moves on. In 1969, he said, King Crimson were temporarily visited by the spirit of genius, and they made that one record. He wasn't saying all their other records aren't good too, but he said that record had the magic. And then the spirit of genius moved on, maybe to Pink Floyd, who did Dark Side Of The Moon, or whoever it was took the next step into creative genius. That's a really interesting point. Because I think there's no artist who hasn't made at least one below-par record, so how does that square with the notion of them as a genius?"

D: He played Dylan McKay, the brooding, broken loner who exuded the kind of self-possession that is only ever won through tragedy, the kind that always leaves a mark. He of the white T-shirts and the too cool had eyes that shocked us with their softness, and a recklessness that made us worry for him. He wore vulnerability like an open secret. He taught a generation how to smolder.
